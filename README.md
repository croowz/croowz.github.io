# My Personal Site

My personal website showcasing my professional experience and background. Visit it at [ryancruz.com](https://ryancruz.com/)

## What's Here

- A simple site made with overkill frameworks to practice using them.
- Shows my work history and education.
- Neat features like dark mode, progressive enhancement for images, and a menu of links to some stuff that may be useful for a cv site.

## Working on it

1. Make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed.
2. Clone this code to your computer.
3. Open the folder in your terminal.
4. Run: `bun install`
5. Then run: `bun run dev`
6. The site will open in your web browser (usually at `http://localhost:5173`).

## Building the Site

Currently, this is all handled by [CloudFlare Pages](https://dash.cloudflare.com/). The site is built and deployed automatically when changes are pushed to the `source` branch.
